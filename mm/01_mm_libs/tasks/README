Do not re-invent the wheel!

== 1.1 ==
- Load GNU Scientific Library
  module load gsl
- Use GNU Scientific Library for matrix-matrix multiplication.
  See: https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/blas.html
  Example: https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/BLAS-Examples.html
- cd gsl/
- Read and follow TODOs in mm.c 
- Measure actual computation time with "gettimeofday"
  See: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/gettimeofday.2.html            
  Example: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/measure-execution-time-with-high-precision-in-c-c/
- To build: make
- To run: ./mm <matrix_size>

== 1.2 ==
- Measure computation time for matrices sizes 1024, 2048, 4096. 

== OPTIONAL ==
== 1.3 == 
- Build application with MKL.
- Measure computation time for matrices sizes 1024, 2048, 4096.
- Compare with results from 1.2
