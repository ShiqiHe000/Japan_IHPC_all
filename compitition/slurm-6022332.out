	- This script is meant to be run as follows: './run.sh LANGUAGE IMPLEMENTATION SIZE [OUTPUT_FILE]'
	- LANGUAGE = 'C' | 'FORTRAN'
	- IMPLEMENTATION = 'serial' | 'openmp' | 'mpi' | 'hybrid_cpu' | 'openacc' | 'hybrid_gpu'
	- SIZE = 'small' | 'big'
	- OUTPUT_FILE = the path to the file in which store the output. If no output file is given, the output is printed in the console.
	- Example: to run the C serial version on the small grid, run './run.sh C serial small'.
